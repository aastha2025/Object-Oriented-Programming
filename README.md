# Object-Oriented-Programming


## basic_OOPs

### Class And Objects:
- Class :: Class is like a BLUEPRINT of these entities.

- Objects :: Objects are ENTITIES in the real world. Object has some properties and methods.

### Access Modifiers:
 - private(by deafault): Data & methods accessibke inside class
- public: Data & methods accessible to everyone.
- protected: Data & methods accessible inside class & to its derived class.



## 4pillars:

### Abstraction:
- Hiding all unnecessary details & showing only the important parts.
 -       ----------(sensitive info)----------------
- one of the way is : Use of access modifier we can implement abstractions.

### Encapsulation:
- Encapsulation: It is wrapping up of data & member funcitons in a single unit called class.
 - Combination of  data/properties + member function  written in class called encapsulation.

- Helps in data hiding : hide sensitive information by using private access modifier.
   
### Polymorphism:
- poly: multiple and morph: forms 

- Polymorphism is the ability of objects to take on  DIFFERENT FROMS or behave in different ways DEPENDING ON THE CONTEXT in which they are used.

- There are 2 types of polymorphism

- 1) Compile Time Polymorphism (Constuctor overloading , Function overloading ,Operator overloading)

- 2) Run Time Polymorphism (Function Overriding , Virtual Functions)

### Inheritance:
- When properties & member functions of BASE class are passed on to the DERIVED class.
####  5 Types:
- Single Inheritance.
- Multi-level Inheritance.
- Multiple  Inheritance.
- Hierarchal Inheritance.
- Hybrid Inheritance.

### **DIFFERENCE B?W DATA HIDING AND ABSTRACTION**

- in data hiding : hiding of data is done only.
- in abstraction along with hiding of data , showing of important data is done as well.
